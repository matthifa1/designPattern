# Design Pattern without OOP: 
## Abstract Data Type & State machine
Implementation of a state machine that uses abstract Data type in C/C++

## main.cpp
Contains the client code of the State machine (Context)

## abstractDataType.cpp
Demonstration of an incomplete Data Type that hides its implementation to the user.

## state.cpp
Contains the Interface to the States and a default implementation of the States
in case that a concrete State is not implemented in the stateX.cpp

## stateX.cpp
Contains the Implementation of the available States
